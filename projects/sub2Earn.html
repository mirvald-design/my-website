                <h1 class="title-project">Task</h1>
                <p class="paragraph-project">The client came in with the challenge of creating a platform that would
                    attract user interest in
                    social account subscriptions and also provide account owners with the means to monetize them.</p>
                <h1 class="title-project">Problem</h1>
                <p class="paragraph-project">Many users experience low motivation to sign up for new social accounts,
                    and account owners face
                    limited opportunities to monetize their platforms.</p>
                <h1 class="title-project">Decision</h1>

                <h1>Task</h1>
                <p>The client came in with the challenge of creating a platform that would attract user interest in
                    social account subscriptions and also provide account owners with the means to monetize them.</p>
                <h1>Problem</h1>
                <p>Many users experience low motivation to sign up for new social accounts, and account owners face
                    limited opportunities to monetize their platforms.</p>
                <h1>Decision</h1>
                <p>1- Authorization
                    We have developed a simple registration system via Google accounts or phone numbers specifically for
                    Influencers.</p>
                <img src="/img/sub2earn/img2.png">
                <p>2. Creating Campaigns:
                    For Influencers, we have provided the ability to create personalized campaigns with set
                    rewards for subscriptions. Campaigns can be either public or private.</p>
                <p>3. Statistics Management:
                    Influencers can monitor the statistics of their campaigns, evaluate their performance and make
                    adjustments to best engage audiences.</p>
                <p>4. Subscriber Participation:
                    Regular users can register, add their social accounts and participate in the
                    Influencer campaigns, receiving cash rewards for subscribing.</p>
                <p>5. Security and Trust:
                    We have ensured maximum security and data privacy to ensure that every participant on the platform
                    feel confident.</p>
                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                <p>The result of our work was the Sub2Earn platform, which turned ordinary subscriptions into valuable
                    assets. Influencers were able to monetize their accounts, expand their audience, and easily
                    to manage campaigns. Ordinary users began receiving real rewards for their
                    activity, creating a mutually beneficial interaction.</p>
